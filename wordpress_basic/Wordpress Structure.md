# ðŸ”¥Wordpress Structure ðŸ”¥

WordPress can be installed on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX host. For this module, we will focus on a default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server. WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at /var/www/html.

Below is the directory structure of a default WordPress install, showing the key files and subdirectories necessary for the website to function properly.
